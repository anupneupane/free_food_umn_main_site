In need of refactoring:

form_entered_time_to_seconds function is duplicated in event_spec.rb and in models/event.rb
It needs to be put in a common module

duplicate code in models/event_spec.rb: the tests after Event.create/Event.new -> event.save

next_month and previous_month helpers can be refactoring according to the template method pattern

instead of figuring out why delete requests were not working, I hacked around it. This isn't
pretty but not the end of the world. Still, not the rails way and it would be nice to fix.
