In need of refactoring:

form_entered_time_to_seconds function is duplicated in event_spec.rb and in models/event.rb
It needs to be put in a common module

duplicate code in models/event_spec.rb: the tests after Event.create/Event.new -> event.save

instead of figuring out why delete requests were not working, I hacked around it. This isn't

mobile view might crash if there aren't any events. However, our business will crash if
there aren't any events, so this might be a moot point.
