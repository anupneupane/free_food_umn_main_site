    - ! "Every year in Pakistan, many people - the majority of them women - are known
      to be victimized by brutal acid attacks, while numerous other cases go unreported.
      With little or no access to reconstructive surgery, survivors are physically
      and emotionally scarred. Many reported assailants, often a husband or someone
      else close to the victim, receive minimal if any punishment from the state.\r\nRecently
      honored with a Best Documentary Short Oscar®. SAVING FACE chronicles the lives
      of acid-attack survivors Zakia and Rukhsana as they attempt to bring their assailants
      to justice and move on with their lives. The women are supported by NGOs, sympathetic
      policy-makers, and skilled doctors, such as the Acid Survivors Foundation-Pakistan,
      plastic surgeon Dr. Mohammad Jawad, who returns to his home country to assist
      them, attorney Ms. Sarkar Abbass who fights Zakia's case, and female politician
      Marvi Memon who advocates for new legislation. SAVING FACE is an intimate look
      inside Pakistani society, illuminating each woman's personal journey while showing
      how reformers are tackling this horrific problem."

      looks at China's occupation of Tibet from the perspective of the vocally secessionist
